### Hi there 👋

I am a Cloud DevOps Engineer, AWS enthusiast, and motivated life-long learner! 👩‍🏫 Currently I am sharpening my skills in AWS, Python, Linux, Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins and Terraform.
When I'm not learning new technologies, I am creating art 🎨, practicing yoga & meditation 🧘‍♀️, taking walks 🏞️, listening to podcasts 🎧, and reading fantastic books 📚.
Let's connect!
